#### Install with NPM

```sh
$ npm install ids-angular-toolbox
```

#### Manual download

After downloading dependencies (or better yet, referencing them from your favorite CDN) the ids-angular-toolbox.js and ids-angular-toolbox.min.js files under the dist directory are all you need.

### Adding dependency to your project

When you are done downloading all the dependencies and project files the only remaining part is to add dependencies on the `ids.dirtoolbox` AngularJS module:

```js
angular.module('myModule', ['ids.dirtoolbox']);
```
